### What up my friends

Pretty soon you'll actually need to use CSS to actually make stuff
look the way that you want it to in your website. Otherwise your 
layouts will be really ugly and no one will like them. Everyone will
hate them. Not love them. Hate them.

What, there is more to this? There is another paragraph you say?
How could that be. This CSS stuff is very important you know. Some
people think that just the brilliance of their idea is going to be
enough to use things. But I'll tell you what, it's not. Not even close.
People actually need to know what to do.

You heard.

Don't think you can just right some code like this:
```javascript
console.log("Who are you")
console.log("Actually never mind")
console.log("Doesn't matter, I just solved all your problems")
```
And then think that all these VC people are going to be lining up
ready and willing to give $1.5 billion. Be better.
